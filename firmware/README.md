# Firmware

Here you will find firmwares for both the STM32F205 (*not* the JTAG one) and the
nRF51.

The only dependency is ChibiOS, which needs be placed in this directory, either
directory or symlinked to a global one (recommended).

- `nrf51`: Firmware for the nRF51 MCU
- `ChibiOS`: ChibiOS 17.x source files (to download)
- `ChibiOS-Contrib`: ChibiOS community contributions for ChibiOS 17.x
  (to download)
